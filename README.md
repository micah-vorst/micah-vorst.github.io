# Micah Vorst — Personal Portfolio

Welcome 👋  
This repository is home to my personal website and a growing collection of projects, experiments, and ideas that reflect both my professional work and personal interests.

## About Me

I’m a self-service and customer experience leader with over a decade of experience designing scalable ways for people to find answers, remove friction, and feel supported.

Professionally, I focus on the strategy and execution behind:
- Support portals, knowledge bases, and online communities  
- Content and search experiences that scale (and are AI-ready)  
- Reducing customer effort while improving operational efficiency  
- Cross-functional collaboration with Support, Product, Marketing, and Engineering  

I care deeply about practical outcomes — clearer answers, fewer dead ends, and systems that work for both customers *and* the teams supporting them.

## Beyond Work

Outside of work, I’m a husband, a dad to two young boys, and someone who values simplicity and presence. I enjoy being outdoors, building things (digital and physical), and continuously learning.

You’ll often find me:
- Exploring Arizona landscapes  
- Camping or hanging out with my family  
- Tinkering on small projects  
- Improving systems just enough to make life a little easier  

I try not to take myself too seriously — work matters, but people matter more.
