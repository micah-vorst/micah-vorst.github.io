<strong>Micah Vorst - Personal Portfolio</strong>

Welcome to my GitHub! This repository serves as the home for my professional and personal life, including projects and interests.

<strong>About Me</strong>

I'm passionate about tech and fostering a collaborative team spirit. As a Self-Service program manager, I enjoy working alongside others to see projects through to completion. I am equally enthusiastic about the outdoors, whether in my hammock, camping with family, or working on a project (which often provides a good justification for a new power tool!).

<i>This README and the website are a work in progress, so come back often.</i>
